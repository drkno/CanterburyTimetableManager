Canterbury Timetable Manager
==========================

Fork of Uni Timetable Manager (http://jack.valmadre.net/timetable/) specifically for the University of Canterbury.

Updated to add automatic downloading of your specific timetable and to allow automatic setting of your courses back on MyTimetable. Also removed some of the bloat from the origional program with the aim of compleately overhauling the interface longer term.


From the origional description:

The timetable manager calculates the best possible timetable you can choose this semester. You can select which criteria to optimise against, such as the number of days at uni, the average start time, the total time at uni or even the longest block of consecutive classes. There's also a swish drag-drop interface for making manual adjustments.
