Canterbury Timetable Manager
==========================

Designed for University of Canterbury students to select the best possible timetable for your course based on a set of criteria. Updated to add automatic downloading of your specific timetable and to allow automatic setting of your courses back on MyTimetable. Also removed some of the bloat from the origional program with the aim of compleately overhauling the interface longer term. Can export your timetable as different types of images or set it as your desktop background.

Version 1.0.0.2:
Works with the new MyTimetable interface provided at the beginning of 2014 S1. Medium level of interface improvements and code changes from the origional.

This program is a fork of University Timetable Manager (http://jack.valmadre.net/timetable/) specifically for the University of Canterbury.
From the origional description:

The timetable manager calculates the best possible timetable you can choose this semester. You can select which criteria to optimise against, such as the number of days at uni, the average start time, the total time at uni or even the longest block of consecutive classes. There's also a swish drag-drop interface for making manual adjustments.
