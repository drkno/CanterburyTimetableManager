CanterburyTimetableManager
==========================

Fork of Uni Timetable Manager (http://jack.valmadre.net/timetable/) specifically for Canterbury University.

From the origional description:
The timetable manager calculates the best possible timetable you can choose this semester. You can select which criteria to optimise against, such as the number of days at uni, the average start time, the total time at uni or even the longest block of consecutive classes. There's also a swish drag-drop interface for making manual adjustments.
